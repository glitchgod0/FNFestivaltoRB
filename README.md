DO NOT USE ONYX ON THESE FOR ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE CONVERTING TO PS3. THEY WILL WORK ON RB3/RB2/RB1.
Read onyx.txt for more information.
Welcome to the FEStoRB repo.

These are beautifully recreated tracks from Fortnite Festival, recreated painstakingly for RB format.
Below is a list of all songs currently completed. (Hand authored) 

(All other songs have a basic Onyx conversion, located in the basic conversions folder)

*Note that RB1/RB2 cons will still load in RB3 just fine. Do not attempt to convert to an RB3 con yourself, you will break the con.*
